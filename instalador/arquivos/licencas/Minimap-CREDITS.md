## Original minimap

**elxokker (xoker)** created the Enshrouded Minimap on which this fork is based.
The minimap renderer, map assets, frame, original icon atlas and original mod
structure come from that project.

- [Original source](https://github.com/elxokker/Enshrouded-minimap)
- [Original Nexus mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/enshrouded/mods/97)

This is an independent community-maintained fork by **Aerox912**, not an official
update from elxokker. It includes the changes submitted upstream as
[PR #5](https://github.com/elxokker/Enshrouded-minimap/pull/5) and
[PR #6](https://github.com/elxokker/Enshrouded-minimap/pull/6).
Please report problems with this build to the fork's issue tracker.

  the required native mod loader and API.
- **o-shabashov**: marker-layout findings and display/graphics ideas in
  [upstream PR #4](https://github.com/elxokker/Enshrouded-minimap/pull/4).
